# Project01-Banking-App
This project will have the following features when you run the Main.java file:
- Create a new account
- Have the ability to switch between accounts
- Require a four digit pin to access the account
- Deposit money to the account
- Withdraw money from the account
- Check balance
- Change pin

## Tips
Since this project has only a few operations and is fairly simple you will be able to complete this with two or three classes.

### Person / Account Class
One class that is required would be a Person class (feel free to name it whatever you want as long as it has a logical name);
and in this class you should have a few member variables like name, pin, and balance. This class should also have some accessor
and mutator methods to retrieve and change the member variables.

### Main class
The Main class is where you will be implementing all of the main menu options to login, select account options (such as deposit,
withdraw, check balance, etc.), and most likely have a member variable that will hold all the different accounts that exist (this
could be done in a seperate class for better organization but is not required). This class may also need a few methods to do
certain operations such as switching between menus or checking for a correct pin.
